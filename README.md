Work
------

### Day 0
**GOAL:** Research APIs
* Looked at a few 3rd party MTG APIs
* Found 2 that might work
* Picked the one that seemed simpler
* Read through documentation thuroghly

### Day 1
**GOAL:** Create backend API / Start frontend
* Scaffolded backend
* Modifed backend files to require authentication for actions
* Modified deck index route to return only public decks
* Added a unique path for getting all of a user's decks
* Created base for frontend
* Got auth crud working
* Created a path/form for creating decks
* Tested 3rd party API requests

### Day 2
**GOAL:** Finish decks Get cards from 3rd party Add cards to decks
* Created two index and a view componenet / paths for decks
* Created template for displaying decks
* Worked extensively getting the 3rd party API working
* Created template for displaying cards
* Added requests for adding/removing a card to a deck
* Created form for adding a query to the 3rd party API request to get specific cards
* Realized the limitations of the current 3rd party API

### Day 3
**GOAL:** Rework with other 3rd party API
* Reworked form to create correct URI Encoded requests to new API
* Adjusted card template to match the new data

* Fixed issues with deployed backend
* Removed or fixed query options that were not functioning as intended
* Reworded some site/message text to make things more clear

Process
------
* Methodically worked on code feature-by-feature
* Tested code thoroughly after each new feature was added (TDD)
* Planned for the future and was constantly looking out for things that might cause trouble later on

Problem-Solving Strategy
------

* Utilized online resources such as StackOverflow to investigate ways to resolve issues
* Pinpointed issues by using console.log
* Discussed and resolved code issues with the help of others

Plans for Future Improvements
------
* Improve styling for a nicer looking site
* Add more query options for more accurate serches
* Add a previous button for navigating result pages
